Edited from [HarvardAnglia.XSL](https://github.com/codingo/BibWord/blob/master/styles/HarvardAnglia.XSL)
  
Based on [USW Referencing](https://library.southwales.ac.uk/collections-subject-guides/referencing/)
  
## How it's different from Harvard:

- Square brackets [ ] are replaced with angle brackets ( ) 
- No comma after the author's name 
- No full stop after the year
