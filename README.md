# USW-Referencing

Edited from [HarvardAnglia.XSL](https://github.com/codingo/BibWord/blob/master/styles/HarvardAnglia.XSL)
  
Based on [USW Referencing](https://library.southwales.ac.uk/collections-subject-guides/referencing/)
  
How it's different from Harvard:

Square brackets [ ] are replaced with angle brackets ( )
No comma after the author's name
No full stop after the year
