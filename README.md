# USW-Referencing

Edited from [HarvardAnglia.XSL](https://github.com/codingo/BibWord/blob/master/styles/HarvardAnglia.XSL)
  
Based on [USW Referencing](https://library.southwales.ac.uk/collections-subject-guides/referencing/)

This was intended for personal use during my applied cybersecurity course.

This was not intended for use in any other subject, including Psychology, History, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Science, Forensic Science and Law, as these subjects require their own different referencing style.

This is not endorsed or backed by University of South Wales. Use at your own risk.

## How it's different from Harvard:

- Square brackets [ ] are replaced with angle brackets ( ) 
- No comma after the author's name 
- No full stop after the year 
- Double colon after "Accessed"
