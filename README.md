# USW-Referencing

Edited from [HarvardAnglia.XSL](https://github.com/codingo/BibWord/blob/master/styles/HarvardAnglia.XSL)
  
Based on [USW Referencing](https://library.southwales.ac.uk/collections-subject-guides/referencing/). Up-to-date as of 29th November 2021.

This was intended for personal use during my applied cybersecurity course.

This was not intended for use in any other subject, including Psychology, History, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Science, Forensic Science and Law, as these subjects require their own different referencing style.

This is not endorsed or backed by University of South Wales. Nor is it complete, as I primarily reference websites. 

Use at your own risk. Read the full README so you lessen the risk of forgetting something.

## How it's different from Harvard:

- Square brackets [ ] are replaced with angle brackets ( ) 
- Entirely removed [Online] thing
- No comma after the author's name 
- No full stop after the year 
- Double colon after "Accessed"
- Edition gains an "n" (edn instead of ed)

## What it's missing:
- Web pages with no authors need to be italicised. 
- Due to reasons out of my experience, my style will put "Anon." as the author. This is wrong.
